    //           Hello, my name is Anasio Claeys, and I am a student currently pursuing a Bachelor's
    //           degree in Applied Computer Science at Hogeschool Gent (HOGENT). I have a keen interest
    //           in Mobile and Enterprise Development and plan to specialize in this area for my
    //           degree.
    //           <br />
    //           <br />
    //           As a software developer, I prioritize quality, efficiency, and innovation in my work.
    //           I am committed to following Agile methodologies to ensure that my code is both
    //           functional and maintainable. In addition to my technical skills, I am an excellent
    //           communicator and team player, able to collaborate with others to achieve project
    //           goals.
    //           <br />
    //           <br /> Some of my other qualities as a software developer include a strong attention
    //           to detail, problem-solving abilities, and the ability to learn quickly and adapt to
    //           new technologies. I am confident that my skills and experience will enable me to excel
    //           in my studies and contribute meaningfully to the software development industry. Thank
    //           you for taking the time to get to know me a little better.
